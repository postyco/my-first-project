        ### Summary of the 48 Laws of Power:

        2. **Never Put Too Much Trust in Friends, Learn How to Use Enemies:**
           Friends are more likely to betray because of envy. An enemy turned friend will be loyal.
           <br>
        
        3. **Conceal Your Intentions:**

           Being vague and mysterious creates an air of power and intimidates.
           <br>
        
        5. **So Much Depends on Reputation – Guard It with Your Life:**
           Reputation is the cornerstone of power. Maintain and defend it fiercely.
